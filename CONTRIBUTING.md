## Helping out

We always welcome people looking to help make Modis bigger and better! To get started, check the issues for anything marked 'help wanted' without any assignees. If there's nothing there, then asking over in our [Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/z83UGvK) for things to do, or checking the 'projects' tab are good places to find things to work on. Remember: you should ask the before starting work on something, to make sure that you aren't doing the same work as somebody else.

### New Features

You have a new idea for something you want in Modis? Great! If you want it included in Modis, it's best to message the devs and check that it's ok. We'll probably say yes but we also don't want to have blocks of code thrown at us in case it isn't something we want in our core codebase.

### Making changes

First, you'll want to clone Modis locally to your own computer. Create a new branch for whatever it is you're working on from the 'unstable' branch, and name is something useful (like module/my-module, or bugfix/my-bugfix). Work on your code in that branch, and when you're ready to submit your changes make a pull request back into 'unstable' from your branch.

## Issues

### Bugs

When submitting bugs to issues make sure that you provide steps on how to reproduce the bug, as well as any relevant system information.

> For example: a bad bug report would be "Music module crashes". A better one would be "Music module crashes when playing geo-locked videos", and giving steps and a link in the description.

### Features

Features can be either additions to existing modules, or new modules you'd like to see added. When suggesting features, make sure to give a clear idea of what you're asking for: descriptions, links, and images help!

### Questions/Problems

For questions, or for things that might be related to your installation of Modis rather than the codebase, check out our [Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/z83UGvK) to get help with setting up Modis.
