# MODIS

Latest release: [v0.4.0 Beta](https://github.com/Infraxion/modis/releases/tag/0.4.0)

## About Modis

Modis is a Discord bot that runs with a GUI and is designed to be as modular as possible so that anyone with some basic Python knowledge can quickly and easily create new modules that run on the bot.

## Current Modules

There are currently 10 available modules:

- `!core` - Handles the core functions of Modis.
- `bethebot` - bethebot let's the bot's owner send messages as Modis.
- `gamedeals` - gamedeals uses Reddit to find the best game deals.
- `help` - help lists the help commands for all modules, as well as the commands for specific modules.
- `hex` - hex looks for hex values in your messages, and displays a solid block image if it finds a value. hex works with any 3 or 6 digit hex values starting with '#' or '0x'.
- `manager` - manager allows users to activate and deactivate modules within a server, and change the server prefix for Modis.
- `music` - music plays videos and playlists from YouTube, and music files stored on the internet.
- `replies`
- `rocketleague` - rocketleague lets you look up player's Rocket League stats.
- `tableflip`
